<h2>Jabberwocky website</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.umass.edu/english/jabberwocky">Jabberwocky</a> is a student-run literary journal affiliated with the UMass English department (though any UMass student can submit writing). They do not currently have a website (just a mention on the UMass English Dept. website), so this would allow our editorial board to post digital versions of past issues, call for submissions, list contact info, and so on.</p>

<h2>First-time Home Buyers website</h2>

<p>This would be an informational website for first-time home buyers. I am interested in this topic and would like a chance to do further research. The core sections of the website would probably follow the general process of home-buying: what can you afford? (financing/loans), shopping for homes, making an offer, home inspections, and closing the sale.</p>
